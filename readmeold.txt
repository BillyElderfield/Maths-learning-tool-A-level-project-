The server would in practise be hosted elsewhere and every client would be able to conenct to the single database. 
To test the program however, instead of having a server that I host at home running 24/7 you just run the server yourself.
I have sucessfully hosted the server at home with port forwarding and can demonsterate if you would like some time,
however the school wi-fi blocks the connection as well.

Passlib is a module that I did not write any of the code for.

Passlib-
Passlib is a password hashing library for Python 2 & 3,
which provides cross-platform implementations of over 30 password hashing algorithms,
as well as a framework for managing existing password hashes.
