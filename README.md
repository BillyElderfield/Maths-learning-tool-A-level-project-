This is coursework that I submitted for A-level Computer Science. The writeup contains an extensive explaination of what the program
does and how I created it.

A brief explaination is that it's a program that allows users to complete randomly generted maths worksheets on a range of topics,
as well as compete against another user in a realtime 1v1 mode with online elo matchmaking (duels). Users have profiles where their elo,
duel history and other customisable information is displayed.

The database and game server utilise low-level socket networking, multithreading and a SQL database. The main client is fully developed
using OOP.

A video demonstration of completing a duel and viewing a profile: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDVTawTQFCM&t=1s
